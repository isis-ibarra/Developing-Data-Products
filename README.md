Peer-graded Assignment: Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, we will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, we will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

The web application developed can be found at: https://isisibarra.shinyapps.io/DiamondPrice/
The ui.R and server.R files needed to code the application, can be found in this repository. 

For the presentation and documentation on this web application, please refer to http://rpubs.com/isis_ibarra/diamondsPrice. 
The .Rpres, .html and .Rmd files needed to build this presentation can be found in this repository.
